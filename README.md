## üöÄ Overview

ClaudeCode-Kiro-Workflow is a powerful AI-driven development workflow system designed specifically for Claude Code. Inspired by the SPECS (Specification-Driven Development) workflow from Kiro IDE, it brings structured, safe, and efficient development practices to Claude Code. The system guides developers through a proven process from requirements to implementation, featuring automatic database backups, Git branch isolation, and seamless session recovery.

This system uses Claude Code's `.claude/commands` mechanism, providing a simplified command system and native Chinese interaction support.

## üìã Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/kiro-start [feature]` | Start new SPECS workflow (auto-guides through phases) | `/kiro-start user-login` |
| `/kiro-next` | Execute next uncompleted task | `/kiro-next` |
| `/kiro-info [info]` | Save project context to `.specs/project-info.md` | `/kiro-info "MySQL DB, React 18"` |
| `/kiro-save` | Save progress and generate session file | `/kiro-save` |
| `/kiro-end` | Complete feature (update docs, generate summary, merge) | `/kiro-end` |
| `/kiro-git` | Immediately commit current changes | `/kiro-git` |
| `/kiro-change` | Return to planning workflow for requirement changes | `/kiro-change` |

## üîÑ Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements Clarification
**Goal**: Transform vague ideas into structured requirement documents
- User story format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) acceptance criteria
- Hybrid approach: Quick initial draft + targeted clarification of key issues
- **Key Constraints**: Limit initial questions to critical information (max 2-3), must obtain user approval after creating requirements.md

### Phase 2: Design & Research
**Goal**: Develop comprehensive design solution based on requirements
- Analyze existing codebase patterns and architecture
- Create technical design with decision rationale
- Research integration points and dependencies
- Support Mermaid diagrams in design documents
- **Key Constraints**: Include sections for overview, architecture, component interfaces, data models, error handling, testing strategy

### Phase 3: Task Planning
**Goal**: Create executable implementation plan based on requirements and design
- Break down into independently executable coding tasks
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Use decimal notation (1.1, 1.2, 2.1) for task hierarchy
- Each task includes implementation details as sub-items
- **Key Constraints**: Focus only on tasks that involve writing, modifying, or testing code; avoid non-coding tasks

### Phase 4: Task Execution
**Goal**: Execute implementation tasks according to SPECS documents
- Strict single-task execution principle
- Must read all SPECS documents before execution
- Real-time progress updates in tasks.md
- Automatic task status synchronization
- **Key Constraints**: Clear separation from planning phase, execute only one task at a time, wait for user instruction after completion

## üîí Security Mechanisms

### Automatic Database Backup
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects database configuration at startup
- **Proactive Reminder**: Prompts for backup when database config is found
- **Auto Execution**: Performs complete database backup upon confirmation
- **Backup Path**: `.specs/backups/db/{feature}_backup_{timestamp}.sql`
- **Zero Data Loss**: Ensures data safety during development

### Git Branch Isolation
- **Auto Feature Branch**: Each feature gets isolated branch `feature/[name]`
- **Main Branch Protection**: No direct operations on main branch during development
- **Status Check**: Ensures clean Git workspace before creating branch
- **Smart Merge**: Merges to main only after feature completion
- **Conflict Prevention**: Isolated development prevents code conflicts

### Document Integrity Protection
- **Atomic Operations**: Document updates either all succeed or all rollback
- **State Consistency**: Ensures requirements, design, tasks documents stay in sync
- **Progress Persistence**: Automatically saves task progress to prevent loss
- **Version Tracking**: All document changes automatically tracked in Git

### Error Recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: Single operation failure doesn't affect overall flow
- **Smart Retry**: Automatic retry for network or temporary errors
- **State Recovery**: Resume from breakpoint after abnormal interruption
- **Detailed Logs**: Complete error information for troubleshooting

### Session Continuity Protection
- **Auto Progress Save**: `/kiro-save` generates complete session recovery file
- **Context Preservation**: New sessions can seamlessly continue previous work
- **Task State Persistence**: Completed tasks never lost
- **Cross-session Collaboration**: Supports team member handover

## üéØ Command Features

- **`/kiro-save`**: Saves progress and generates session recovery file, solving AI session context limitations
- **`/kiro-end`**: Completes feature development, generates summary document and merges to main branch
- **`/kiro-git`**: Quick code commit without updating progress documents
- **`/kiro-change`**: Intelligently handles requirement changes, automatically updates related documents while preserving completed status

## üé® Best Practices

### Workflow Adherence
1. **Trust AI Workflow**: Let AI guide you through optimal development process
2. **Provide Clear Requirements**: Clearer input leads to more accurate AI-generated documents
3. **Follow Approval Gates**: Each phase requires explicit approval before continuing
4. **Focus on Single Task**: Execute one task at a time, wait for confirmation

### Session Management
5. **Regular Progress Saves**: Use `/kiro-save` before ending sessions
6. **Use Session Prompts**: Start new sessions with generated prompts
7. **Configure Project Info**: Setup `/kiro-info` project information before first use

### Error Handling
8. **Understand Failures**: Check specific error messages when encountering issues
9. **Use Recovery Suggestions**: Follow AI-provided recovery recommendations
10. **Manage Requirement Changes**: Use `/kiro-change` for changes instead of direct modification

### Security Practices
11. **Database Backups**: Ensure database is backed up before development
12. **Branch Isolation**: Ensure working on correct feature branch
13. **Progressive Commits**: Use `/kiro-git` for regular code commits

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Option A: Quick Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Copy entire .claude folder to your project
cp -r .claude your-project/
```

### Option B: Custom Installation
If you already have `.claude` configurations:
1. Copy command files from `docs/commands/*.md`
2. Place them in your `.claude/commands/` directory
3. Ensure filenames match: `kiro-start.md`, `kiro-save.md`, etc.

### Start Using
```
/kiro-start [feature_name]
```
