# cc-analyze
Perform intelligent code analysis with expert agent selection.

REQUIRED: Scan project structure to identify technology characteristics
REQUIRED: Analyze target code to determine functional domain and complexity
REQUIRED: Use AI reasoning to select most appropriate expert agent
REQUIRED: Provide clear reasoning for agent selection
REQUIRED: Save analysis results to `.specs/analysis/code-analysis-{target}-{timestamp}.md`

PROHIBITED: Modifying, editing, or executing code during analysis
PROHIBITED: Using hardcoded agent selection rules
PROHIBITED: Creating implementation files during analysis

Analysis Process:
1. Scan project structure and identify tech stack
2. Analyze target characteristics and complexity
3. Use AI reasoning to select expert agent
4. Delegate analysis with comprehensive context
5. Save results with timestamp
