# cc-think
Activate deep analysis mode for complex problem solving.

REQUIRED: Activate specified thinking level (v1/v2/v3) based on complexity
REQUIRED: Perform systematic multi-angle analysis of presented problem
REQUIRED: Analyze impacts on existing requirements, design, and tasks
REQUIRED: Present analysis results and proposed solutions before execution
REQUIRED: Request explicit user confirmation before implementing changes

PROHIBITED: Making changes to SPECS documents without user approval
PROHIBITED: Implementing solutions without analysis presentation
PROHIBITED: Assuming thinking level without complexity assessment

Deep Analysis Levels:
- v1: Basic analysis with single perspective
- v2: Enhanced analysis with multiple perspectives and trade-offs
- v3: Comprehensive analysis with system-wide impacts

Analysis Process:
1. Assess problem complexity and select thinking level
2. Perform systematic analysis from multiple angles
3. Evaluate impacts on existing documentation
4. Present findings and proposed solutions
5. Request user confirmation before changes
